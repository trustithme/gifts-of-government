# gifts-of-government
ignoring such as protection functions and others as I go along which seem for the collective good, what has been the trend of government "gifts" to the people (of the people and for the people) since 1790 (first census) using census timing as the sampling point.  Just curious.   Coursera is an example.  its free.
